The idea was that this website automatically downloads songs from spotify by looking for them on youtube and downloading them there.
But I noticed that this already exsists so I stopped this project.

But the token exchange with the spotify api and downloading a mp3 file from a youtube video already worked but everything is
kinda messy.
